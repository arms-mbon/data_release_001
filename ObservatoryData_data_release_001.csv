The project was entitled BlueReef. The purpose of the BlueReef project was to restore and stabilise the structure and function of cavernous boulder reefs within an area of approx. 5ha, as well as to boost awareness among managers, planners and the general public about marine nature restoration, protection and management. Approximately 100.000 tons of rock was added to an existing old reef in 2007. Since then the reef has been monitored annually for both benthic and pelagic (fish and sea mamals) species. The ARMS systems will provide us with an opportunity to compare the traditional type of detailed data with valuable DNA based biodiversity information.  ",
