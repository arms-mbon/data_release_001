These are the data related to the publication XXX and as published in the EurOBIS DOI XXX (to be written once these references exist; give or refer to a list of stations and years that are covered)

The data here are a subset of the sampling event and PEMA processing results taken from [ARMS GitHub working space](https://github.com/arms-mbon/data_workspace). This working space is where data are harvested from the source locations (PlutoF and google sheets for the event data; PEMA google drive for the taxonomic data), quality controlled, and combined into user-friendly formats. To be specific, 
* The sampling event metadata are taken from (our Combined event data)[https://github.com/arms-mbon/data_workspace/tree/main/QualityControlledData/Combined]
* The taxonomic assigments taken from P.E.M.A processing are taken from (our PEMA I/O datea)[https://github.com/arms-mbon/data_workspace/tree/main/AnalysisData/FromPEMA/ProcessingForDataPaper_001]
